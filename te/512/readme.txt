For Spencer Owen 512KB ROM + 512KB RAM memory module

Version supporting "arrow keys" and TABs

TAB intervals (4 or 8, default=8) may be set in the command line: >te file.ext [ 4 | 8 ] 

UPDATE: (4 Jan 2023)

I added TEW.COM, a new version for 512KB RAM systems, for very wide screens (it can handle lines up to 175 characters)
