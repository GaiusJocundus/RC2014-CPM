ZORK I adventure game

Adapted to RC2014 from the Donnie Russsel II Zork1 C code ( https://github.com/donnierussellii/zork1c ) 

Must be played on a RC2014 provided with a 512 MB RAM + 512 MB RAM board and a SIO board (e.g. SC110)
If a Digital I/O board is available, the current (executing) overlay index will be displayed on the leds.

ROM512.hex - store-it (burn-it) to the 512 module's EPROM; it contains a CP/M booter and the ZORK game code overlays.
zork.hex - LOAD it & SAVE it as the ZORK.COM file, to be executed to start the game
zorkcomm.hex - store-it as a file on the same disk as ZORK.COM (it contains code for ZORK)

See the Infocom original manual (included) to learn how to play the game.
